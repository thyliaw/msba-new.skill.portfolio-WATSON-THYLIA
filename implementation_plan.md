# Implementation Plan

## What this repo does
This repository demonstrates how to explore customer churn using SQL. The `telco.csv` dataset is imported into SQLite, and queries analyze churn patterns by tenure, contract type, and services. It shows how a company can identify at-risk customers and understand churn drivers.

## What would need to change for a real company
- Replace sample CSV with real customer data.  
- Add security and privacy controls.  
- Use a production-grade database (PostgreSQL, Snowflake) for larger datasets.  
- Automate queries for regular reporting or dashboards.
